                        Hello, my name is <strong className="orange">Tony</strong> and Iâ€™m a <strong className="orange">passionate software engineer</strong>! I love taking what are originally thoughts and ideas, putting pen to paper
          and then creating fully-fledged web applications! And with new
          technologies on the horizon and the field always evolving, part of the
          thrill is to be on your toes to learn new things. So thank you for
          taking your time visiting my page and I hope you learn more about me
          and the things I can do!{" "}
